# Credit Scorecard Model

![Before using model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101324931/182018577-433cd57c-72b5-49f3-bd82-526dbd37219e.jpg)

Problem statement: 
The loss generated by non-paying customers is quite high. (8,07%)

Goals:
- Predicting potential customers who can borrow money with minimum risk

Objective:
Help minimize these losses by using predictive models to predict customers who are likely to default.
Use AUC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov with target: 
- AUC   : 0,7 
- KS    : 0,3 

# Modeling

Model that we use using Logistic Regression, with AUC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) for Evaluation

We also submit data test that has predicted using this model

# Conclusion

Before we use the model, we know that 8,07 % of Customers indicated failure from data train.

We can predict that 11.61 % of the Test Data will default based on our modeling. As a result, customers who are expected to fail to pay can have their applications canceled.

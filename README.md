# Credit Scorecard Model

Problem statement: 
The loss generated by non-paying customers is quite high. (8,07%)

Goals:
- Predicting potential customers who can borrow money with minimum risk

Objective:
Help minimize these losses by using predictive models to predict customers who are likely to default.
Use AUC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov with target: 
- AUC   : 0,7 
- KS    : 0,3 

# Modeling

Model that we use using Logistic Regression, with AUC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) for Evaluation

We also submit data test that has predicted using this model
